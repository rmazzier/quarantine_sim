# A Quarantine Simulator
This is a **non-finished** hobby game development project, made just by me during the COVID-19 2020 quarantine in Italy. Thanks to Asparagii that implemented the Gaussian Blur shader in GLSL for me.

Living in quarantine can be tiring, but seeing life as a game can help to find always new things to do, and to always have a goal in mind.

This project was made possible and fun thanks to the wonderful [**Godot Engine**](https://godotengine.org/).
All drawings and animations were made by me, using [**Leonardo**](https://www.getleonardo.com/) and [**Krita**](https://krita.org/en/).

## Some Work In Progress Stuff

The idea is that you have three Stats to manage:
- ‚ù§ Sanity;
- ‚ö°Productivity;
- üîãEnergy.

You have to keep them high, alternating various activities, but be aware of how to balance them!

The game should have taken place in the full house: this is where the project started to become too big (and less fun).
